Heart Disease Prediction
This project predicts whether a person has heart disease based on various medical attributes using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset used in this project is the well-known heart disease dataset.

Dataset
The dataset (heart.csv) includes the following features:

age: Age of the patient

sex: Sex of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)

cp: Chest pain type

trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl

fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment

ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy

thal: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect)

target: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)
